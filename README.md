# SCD30-4x-mergeCode
This repository contains Arduino code for calibrating and continuously reading data from Sensirion SCD30 and SCD4x (SCD40/41) CO2 sensors. The primary goal of this project is to provide a flexible framework for accurately calibrating these sensors using an external reference (like an LI-850 CO2 analyzer)
